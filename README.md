# Spatial visualization of San Francisco Police Department Incidents for 2016

## Objectives
Visualize geospatial data with Folium

## Introduction
In this notebook, we will create maps for different objectives. To do that, we will part ways with Matplotlib and work with another Python visualization library, namely Folium. What is nice about Folium is that it was developed for the sole purpose of visualizing geospatial data.

## Tool Kit
This Notebook heavily relies on pandas and Numpy for data wrangling, analysis, and visualization. The primary plotting library we will explore in this lab is Folium.

## Data Set
San Francisco Police Department Incidents for the year 2016 - Police Department Incidents from San Francisco public data portal. Incidents derived from San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) Crime Incident Reporting system. Updated daily, showing data for the entire year of 2016. Address and location has been anonymized by moving to mid-block or to an intersection.
